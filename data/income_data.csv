2,"Data quality indicators are based on the coefficient of variation (CV) and number of observations. Quality indicators indicate the following: A - Excellent (CV between 0% and 2%); B - Very good (CV between 2% and 4%); C - Good (CV between 4% and 8%); D - Acceptable (CV between 8% and 16%); E - Use with caution (CV between 16% and 33.3% )."
3,"In recent years, the Canadian Income Survey (CIS) has introduced improvements to the methods and sources used to produce income estimates. Beginning with the 2021 reference year, CIS income data were produced from the Administrative Personal Income Masterfile, a comprehensive source of personal income data generated not only from T1 tax returns, but also from associated tax slips. CIS estimates for previous years were produced using T1 tax returns only. Please consult the document <a href=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75f0002m/75f0002m2023005-eng.htm rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Improvements to the Canadian Income Survey Methodology for the 2021 Reference Year (opens new window)</a> for more information. More improvements were introduced with the 2022 reference year. Foremost among these improvements is a significant increase in the sample size for a large subset of the CIS content. The weighting methodology was also improved and the target population for income data was changed from persons aged 16 years and over to persons aged 15 years and over. Please consult the document <a href=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75f0002m/75f0002m2024005-eng.htm rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Improvements to the Canadian Income Survey Methodology for the 2022 Reference Year (opens new window)</a> for more information.Please note that at least one variable used in this table was not available for the additional sample. Therefore, the sample size for reference year 2022 and onwards remains similar to prior reference years."
