Ontario hasn't changed

alberta has changed them in 2023 with further changeds running through 2025

sask has other structural changes and might not be a good candidate

bc had a major overhaul in 2015/16 with a 2020 change from retail to wholesale pricing for restraunts(interesting control)

manitoba had some minor changes in 2024(good enough to be a control)


We're looking at if price elasticities of alcohol have changed since the pandemic. This breaks down into why people are drinking less in canada since the pandemic.  
How much of this is price increases(use wine and cider because they skew richer), substitution(unsure how to measure this), or behavioural change(look at bar sales?).
Potential confounds:
	population:
		aging country, older people drink less.
		Record levels of immigration, eg muslim majority countries drink less
	behavioural:
		are people going out as much?
		is this just substitution
	price increase:
		how to parse more quality vs quantity
		
	
Every province is seeing less drinking, we're looking at how much of this is price increases, substitution, or behavioural change. we're going to have to separate each of these
