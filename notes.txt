Ontario hasn't changed 
https://www.ontario.ca/document/beer-and-wine-tax

alberta has changed them in 2023 with further changeds running through 2025

sask has other structural changes and might not be a good candidate

bc had a major overhaul in 2015/16 with a 2020 change from retail to wholesale pricing for restraunts(interesting control)

manitoba had some minor changes in 2024(good enough to be a control)


We're looking at if price elasticities of alcohol have changed since the pandemic. This breaks down into why people are drinking less in canada since the pandemic.  
How much of this is price increases(use wine and cider because they skew richer), substitution(unsure how to measure this), or behavioural change(look at bar sales?).
Potential Vairables:

Demographic/Compositional

Education levels: More educated populations tend to have different drinking patterns
Urbanization shifts: Urban vs. rural drinking cultures differ
Income inequality: Not just average income, but distribution matters
Immigration patterns: Some countries 

Behavioral/Cultural

Health consciousness trends: Rise of wellness culture
Cannabis legalization: Substitution effect in some jurisdictions
Working patterns: Remote work changing after-work drinking culture

Measurement/Definition

Home consumption vs. on-premise: People drinking at home instead of bars (your substitution point)
Type of alcohol: Shift from beer to wine/spirits affects volume measures
Look at number of units of alcohol

Economic (beyond just price)

Real price of alcohol has gone up: look at price elacticities
Disposable income after housing costs: Housing affordability crisis
Relative price changes: Alcohol vs. other entertainment/drugs
Craft beer/premium spirits premium: Quality-quantity tradeoff you mentioned

		
	
Every province is seeing less drinking, we're looking at how much of this is price increases, substitution, or behavioural change. we're going to have to separate each of these
